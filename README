Astro Particle Physics Python [A3P] II

============
Introduction

Astro Particle Physics Python II (A3PII) is a set of programs and tools
to calculate the meta-galactic radiation fields and its attenuation effect
on very high energy gamma-rays via forward folding from a star formation
history and stellar evolution emission models.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a legacy release. It is no longer developed further 
and provided as is.

If you are using this code for a publication please consider citing this

============
Requirements

Required modules:
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pyfits
  - matplotlib

In addition spectra from stellar population modeling (e.g. Starburst 99)
are needed as input for the EBL modeling.

For installation git is recommended

=====
Usage

Make sure to fulfill the requirements.

(1) Download a3p2 from github:
    - Create a directory for a3p2
        mkdir <your_a3p2_directory>
    - Enter the directory
        cd <your_a3p2_directory>
    - Clone from github
        git clone git@github.com:mraue/a3p2.git
      or download and unzip
        https://github.com/mraue/a3p2/archive/master.zip

(2) Add directory to python path:
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<your_a3p2_directory>

(3) Test the installation
    - Enter the installation directory
        cd <your_a3p2_directory>
    - Test drawing the EBL limit collection:
        python scripts/draw_ebl_measurements.py
      If everything went well you should see a plot with
      EBL limits. If not please check the output for errors.
    - Test the EBL model calculation:
        python scripts/calculate_ebl_model.py config/TRY_ME_FIRST_EBL.cfg.py
      This should take some time to calculate. In the end you should
      end up with a plot of the EBL model.
      Run the script without command line parameters to see further options.

(4) Next steps
    - Study the terminal output of calculate_ebl_model.py
    - Study config/TRY_ME_FIRST_EBL.cfg.py
    - Study a3p2/ebl/model.py
    - Run python scripts/plot_ebl_model_sfr.py config/TRY_ME_FIRST_EBL.cfg.py
    - Run calculate_ebl_model.py and create an output file
    - Take a look at the output file (fits)
    - Run scripts/calculate_ebl_attenuation.py
